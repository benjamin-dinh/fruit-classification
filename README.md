# Fruit Classification Using Logistic Regression & Decision Trees

The data set is slightly permutated and is found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkyin/ECS189L/main/fruits.csv

Summary:

- Built a logistic regression classifier to predict the fruit_name variable in terms of the predictors mass, width, height, and color_score.
- Built a decision tree classifier to predict the fruit_name variable in terms of the predictors mass, width, height, and color_score.
- Graphed the decision boundaries for the two models above and determined overall performances.
